### 👋 Hey! I'm Jason!

**Glad to see you here!** :star_struck:

I like to learn and build things 🏘️!<br> 
Probably why I transitioned from architecture into software development. Buildings don't change fast enough...

Curretly at [Turing](https://turing.edu/)'s Front End Engineering program to help me specialize in JavaScript, CSS, and HTML so that I can create applications that will enrich the lives of people who use them.

#### Let's connect! 🤝
