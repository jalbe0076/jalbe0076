### 👋 Hey there! I'm Jason, and I'm thrilled to have you here! 

I have a passion for continuous learning and constructing innovative solutions. That's likely why I made the transition from architecture to software development—buildings just couldn't keep up with my drive for change!

Currently, I'm actively engaged in [Turing](https://turing.edu/)'s Front End Engineering program, honing my skills in JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. My goal is to leverage this expertise to craft impactful applications that enhance the lives of their users.

Feel free to explore my GitHub profile and witness my journey of growth as I embark on exciting projects and collaborate with fellow developers. Together, let's build remarkable experiences that make a difference!
